\textbf{General workflow}:
To accurately detect and estimate the wood knots on target wooden beam, the above roadmap(Figure~\ref{fig:process}) shows the general process of ideal workflow. The whole process is considered in terms of several frequently captured images, each image being processed through the segmentation and detection process, and all the images being composited as a final output when the capture is complete.
