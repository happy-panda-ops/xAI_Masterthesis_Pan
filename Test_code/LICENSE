xAI Masterthesis

Introduction
Welcome to the xAI Masterthesis project repository. This project explores the applications of eXplainable AI (xAI) in computer vision, with a focus on the use of YOLOv8 and Detectron2 models for object detection tasks. The study evaluates these models across various scenarios, providing insights into their performance and interpretability.

The primary goals of this project include:

Developing and training object detection models using YOLOv8 and Detectron2.
Analyzing model performance with xAI techniques.
Providing a reproducible setup for experiments.
This repository contains the source code for model training and some test results, enabling users to replicate the experiments or extend the models for their own projects. Please note that due to file size limitations, Detectron2 models are not included but can be requested through the Issues section.

Features
YOLOv8 Object Detection: Training scripts and test results are provided.
Detectron2 Support: Training scripts available (pre-trained models upon request).
Explainability Modules: xAI techniques integrated for model interpretation.
